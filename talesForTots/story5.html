    <h2>Kitty's Big Debut</h2>
    <p>
        Once upon a time, in a home so bright, <br>
        Lived a kitty with a talent that shone so light. <br>
        She could sing a tune, with a meow so clear,<br>
        But when it came to crowds, she'd freeze with fear.<br><br>
        She'd hide under the bed, and shake with fright,<br>
        At the thought of performing, in the spotlight that night.<br>
        But her owners encouraged her, with love and with cheer,<br>
        And they told her that she had nothing to fear.<br><br>
        So she practiced and practiced, until she was bold,<br>
        And she took to the stage, with a confidence so bold.<br>
        She meowed her song, with a voice so pure,<br>
        And the crowd went wild, with a cheer that was so sure.<br><br>
        She basked in the applause, and preened with delight,<br>
        And she knew that she had conquered, her stage fright that night.<br>
        From that moment on, she sang with such grace,<br>
        And she knew that she was loved, in this special place.
