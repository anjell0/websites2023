                It is JourneyBoiz’s mission to create inspirational, wondrous worlds 
                and stories that under represented groups can relate to. It is hard 
                growing up and not seeing yourself on your TV screen, metaphorically. 
                Some of the brightest and most imaginative minds are left unattended, 
                causing a stunt in the world’s growth in imagination and creativity. 
                JourneyBoiz wishes to inspire each and every underrepresented group 
                to be the best they can be and overcome their life challenges no matter 
                how high the hurdle.
                <br>
                <br>
                JourneyBoiz hopes that through video games, animation, stories, and even 
                music, minds less pandered to will develop a sense of creativity and 
                inspiration to allow them to succeed in whatever endeavors and aspirations 
                they may hold in their heart. Not only is the accomplishment important, but 
                remaining true to their morals and values will hopefully give them a sense 
                of fulfillment. JourneyBoiz wishes every mind from every background, skin 
                color, orientation, and gender to be as great as they aspire to be.
